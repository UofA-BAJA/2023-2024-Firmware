## pip Installs
In Baja, there are a couple of python packages that need to be installed so that you can work on the various programs.
1. Open VS Code (or gany other command terminal), and check for the packages pyserial and gitpython using the "pip list" command.

2. If either of these packages are not installed, install them using the following:

    > pip install pyserial

    > pip install gitpython

3. Once you have done this, use the "pip list" command to check for these files again. They should appear in the displayed list along with their current versions.

pip install
